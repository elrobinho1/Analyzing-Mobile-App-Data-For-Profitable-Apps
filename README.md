We are working as data analysts for a company that builds `free` Android and iOS mobile modile apps for `English-speaking audience`. Their main source of revenue consisting of in-app ads. Thus, the number of users of their apps determines their revenue for any given app.</p>
Our goal for this project is to analyze the data to help the app developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users on Google Play and the Apps Store.

In this project, we use two readily available data sets which are suitable for our goals:

2. A dataset containing data about approximately 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store; the data was collected in July 2017. You can download the data set directly from [App Store data](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/AppleStore.csv).
